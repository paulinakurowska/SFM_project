We define the function called 'simulation' which takes as input size of the dataset and returns the string of:
\begin{itemize}
\item averaged value of estimated $\hat{\alpha}$ 
\item standard deviation of estimated $\hat{\alpha}$ from true parameter $\alpha$ = 0.9
\item number of $\hat{\alpha}$ which are larger or equal to 1 (evidence of the stationarity violation)
\end{itemize}
over k=1000 replications for datasets of size n=100,250,500,1000.
}
\frame{
\frametitle{Monte Carlo Set up continued}
For building that simulation we use the function fitGarch() from fGarch package with specified conditional distribution to be calculated with the Quasi Maximum Likelihood Estimation, the simulated ARCH(1) models are derived with the help of the function garchSim(). 
}
\frame{
\frametitle{Monte Carlo Set up continued}
QMLE assumes normal distribution and uses robust standard errors for inference. Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1992) proved that if the mean and the volatility equations are correctly specified, the QML estimates are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. However, the estimates are not efficient.
